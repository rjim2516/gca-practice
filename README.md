# GCA Practice & Learning Notes

This repo contains my preparation work for the General Coding Assessment (GCA). It includes:
- Practice problems
- Notes on coding strategies
- Python code snippets

## What's Inside
- `arrays/` – Problems related to array manipulation
- `logic/` – If/else, loops, and counting
- `practice_attempts.py` – My working solutions
- `notes.md` – My reflections, learning tips, and what I’ve struggled with

## Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving with arrays and loops
- Improve understanding of question phrasing
- Build confidence through repetition

## Tools
- Python 3
